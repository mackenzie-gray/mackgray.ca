<p class="intro">I'm a web-appplication developer from Toronto, Canada. I've recently graduated from the University of Waterloo in Computer Science. I'm currently a member of the awesome team at <a href="https://wattpad.com" target="_blank">Wattpad</a> full-time as a web engineer.</p>

## Experience
#### SKILLS
Being a web developer, I'm well-versed in Javascript, HTML, CSS and many of the modern frameworks and tooling in the web space right now. My current stack for most projects is usually React.js & Redux, LESS/SASS along with Webpack for bundling. 

I've also become proficient in Python, Java and C++ during my time at Waterloo and I've experimented with React Native & Swift but I plan to dive deeper into these areas as I continue to explore mobile app development in the future.

#### WORK
I'm currently working as a part of the Wattpad Labs team at Wattpad, where we're building new products to help connect and entertain the world through storytelling.

During my time as a coop student at Wattpad I had the opportunity to help transform our PHP application into an isomorphic javascript application that supports server rendering using Express and client rendering using Backbone.js. We've recently integrated React and Redux into our application.

Prior to Wattpad, in 2014 I worked as a co-op student at [Canada Company](https://canadacompany.ca), a non-profit organization helping Canadian Veterans reintroduce themselves into the workforce. Here I was tasked with building the site for the charity using Cascade CMS.
