# MACK GRAY

I'm an web appplication developer from Toronto, Canada. I've recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. In June 2017 I'll be joining [Wattpad](https://wattpad.com) as web engineer to help unleash the full potential of stories to the world.



## EXPERIENCE
#### SKILLS
The coop program at Waterloo allowed me to gain invaluable experience working for a variety of companies and acquiring a ton of skills to help me get the job done. Being a web developer, I'm well-versed in Javascript, HTML and CSS, but I've also become proficient in Python, Java and C++ during my time at Waterloo.

#### WORK
During my coop terms at Wattpad I had the opportunity to help transform a PHP application into an isomorphic javascript application that supports server rendering using Express and client rendering using Backbone.js. We've now integrated React and Redux into our application and are moving our app in this direction a.

Prior to Wattpad, I worked as a co-op student at [Canada Company](https://canadacompany.ca), a non-profit organization helping Canadian Veterans reintroduce themselves into the workforce. Here I was tasked with building the site for the charity using Cascade CMS.
