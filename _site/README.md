I'm an application developer located in Ontario, Canada. I've recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. In June 2017 I'll be joining [Wattpad](https://wattpad.com) as web engineer in Toronto, to help build and scale the web product of the world's largest online entertainment platform.
